This is based on the IEEE research article which explores the different ways to evaluate an Information Retrieval system. This project implements the pooling method to improve relevant judgements. This way of pooling considers the top k documents generated in multiple runs by different systems which will be the relevant documents and those not in the pooled list will be considered irrelevant documents.
